# Requirements that require a C/C++ compiler to build, which may not be available until
# after the toolchain is bootstrapped. Installed after requirements.txt
# These reqirements are also only specifically for builds with ADLS and are not installed
# if the cluster is not configured to use ADLS, since some of these packages require
# CentOS 6.7 and above.
